# devourIT

#### devourIT is an app that creates a burger logger with MySQL, Node.js, Express.js, Handlebars.js and an ORM. It uses Node and MySQL to query and route data to the app, and Handlebars to generate HTML.

* This app allows users to input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.
* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app places the burger in the "Waiting" section.
* Each burger in the waiting section has a DEVOUR button. 
* When the user clicks it, the burger has been devoured and moves to the "Devoured" section.
* The app stores every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.

#### To Install and Run:
* `git clone https://github.com/aolaleye/devour-it.git`
