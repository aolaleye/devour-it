# devourIT

#### devourIT is an app that creates a burger logger with MySQL, Node.js, Express.js, Handlebars.js and an ORM. It uses Node and MySQL to query and route data to the app, and Handlebars to generate HTML.

* This app allows users to input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.
* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app places the burger on the left side of the page -- the waiting room.
* Each burger in the waiting area has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger has been devoured and moves to the right side of the page.
* The app stores every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.

#### How to Install and Run:
* `git clone https://github.com/aolaleye/restaurant.git`
* `cd restaurant`
* `npm i`
* `node server.js`
